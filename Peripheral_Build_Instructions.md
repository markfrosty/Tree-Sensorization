# Sensor Array Assembly Instructions

1. Assuming all parts are present and/or printed, gather the following:

  | Item  | Quanity | Note | 
  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |q
  | Branch mount housing | 3 | Foundation for peripheral sensors |
  | Battery cover Arduino mount | 3 | Covers power system components and allows Arduino to mount |
  | RP2040 base plate | 1 | Provides protection for central device |
  | M2 x 0.4 mm thread, 4 mm length heat set insert | 19 | Each housing requrires 5 and the RP2040 base plate requires 4 | 
  | M1.4 x 0.3 mm thread, 3 mm length heat set insert | 16 | Allow Arduino to be screwed down|
  | Laser cut heat set insert jig | 1 | Allows precise placement of inserts |

2. Affix heat set insert jig to a battery cover arduino mount using double sided tape or a clamp, preheat soldering iron (Optional: an M2 heat set insert tool is very helpful for installing both sizes of inserts), place 4x M1.4 x 0.3 mm thread, 3 mm length heat set inserts in each of the holes in the center of the jig, use soldering iron to get the inserts started and as far down as possible without severly burining the jig(some burning is expected to occur), remove jig once mostly inserted remove jig, finish installing inserts until flush with base.
  - REPEAT 3X FOR ALL BATTERY COVERS
  - Note: For best results, let the heat and the weight of the soldering iron do the work when installing the heat set inserts. This will prevent plastic from filling the inside of the insert

3. Repeat step 2 on RP2040 base plate. Place 4x M2 x 0.4 mm thread, 4 mm length heat set inserts in each corner hole of jig and install them using the same process as before. Ensure they are flsuh with the plate when fully installed.
4. Affix heat set insert jig to a branch mount housing using double sided tape or a clamp, if using double sided tape ensure it will not be burned when installing inserts, place 4x M2 x 0.4 mm thread, 4 mm length heat set inserts in each corner hole of the jig, install inserts, remove jig if still affixed, ensure inserts are flsuh, place 1x M2 x 0.4 mm thread, 4 mm length heat set insert in the hole located in the battery compartment, hold the insert straight and in the right location with metal tweezers and install, ensure flsuh
  - REPEAT 3X FOR ALL BRANCH MOUNT HOUSINGS
