# Sensor Array Assembly Instructions

1. Assuming all parts are present and/or printed, gather the following:

  | Item  | Quanity | Note | 
  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
  | Branch mount housing | 3 | Foundation for peripheral sensors |
  | Battery cover Arduino mount | 3 | Covers power system components and allows Arduino to mount |
  | RP2040 base plate | 1 | Provides protection for central device |
  | M2 x 0.4 mm thread, 4 mm length heat set insert | 19 | Each housing requrires 5 and the RP2040 base plate requires 4 | 
  | M1.4 x 0.3 mm thread, 3 mm length heat set insert | 16 | Allow Arduino to be screwed down|
  | Laser cut heat set insert jig | 1 | Allows precise placement of inserts |
