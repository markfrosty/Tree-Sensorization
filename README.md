# Tree-Sensorization
ROS2 and micro-ROS integration with BLE Transmission of IMU data from Arduino to create positional models.

This is part of a summer research fellowship through the AgAID Institute and Oregon State University College of Engineering Intelligent Machines and Materials Lab.

My goal is to create a model of a tree based on IMU data from an Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect. This IMU data will be transmitted wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy. This is done by publishing this data in a micro-ROS publishing node. This project is very much in the works and will continue to be updated as changes and improvements are made. 

The associated micro-ROS and ROS2 nodes that will be posted here are designed to assist those using wireless communications to publish data, cut down on playful features in most examples, and focus on data collection and publication.
